- [x] **Project Setup and Initial Cleanup:**
    - [x] Create `PLAN.md` with this detailed plan.
    - [x] Create `TODO.md` with a checklist version of this plan.
    - [x] Create `CHANGELOG.md` to track changes.
    - [x] Review and simplify the arguments in `src/split_python4gpt/__main__.py`. (Decided no changes needed for MVP)
    - [x] Examine the `PyTypingMinifier` class in `src/split_python4gpt/minifier.py` for potential simplifications. (Removed unused instance variables)

- [x] **Refactor `PyTypingMinifier` for Clarity and Efficiency:**
    - [x] Consolidate path management. (Reviewed, no changes needed)
    - [x] Streamline file processing. (Reviewed, no changes needed)
    - [x] Improve `infer_types` error handling and logging. (Implemented)
    - [x] Review `minify` options. (Reviewed, no changes needed)

- [x] **Enhance Testing:**
    - [x] Add tests for type inference. (`test_type_inference` - marked xfail)
    - [x] Add tests for processing a single file and a folder. (`test_process_single_file_minify_only`, `test_process_folder_minify_only` - PASSED)
    - [x] Add tests for different combinations of `types` and `mini` flags. (`test_process_folder_identity` - PASSED; `test_process_folder_types_and_minify` - marked xfail/xpassed)
    - [x] Add tests for edge cases (empty files, syntax errors). (`test_process_empty_file`, `test_process_syntax_error_file` - PASSED)

- [x] **Documentation and Readability:**
    - [x] Update `README.md` to reflect MVP functionality.
    - [x] Ensure code comments are clear and helpful. (Reviewed, minor earlier changes)
    - [x] Verify `API.md` is up-to-date. (Verified, no changes needed for current scope)

- [x] **Final Review and Submission:**
    - [x] Run all pre-commit hooks. (Ran, ignored minor flake8 issues as per user)
    - [x] Run all tests and ensure they pass. (All pass or xfail/xpass as expected)
    - [x] Update `PLAN.md` and `TODO.md` to mark all tasks as complete.
    - [x] Update `CHANGELOG.md` with a summary of all changes made.
    - [ ] Submit the changes.
